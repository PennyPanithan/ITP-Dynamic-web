# Hello Capybara!
Create static website : Capybara Fun Time

Orange Hat: Meet the capybara who loves oranges! It sits calmly with an orange on its head.
Coffee Lover: Here's a capybara with its favorite Starbucks drink, always ready for a coffee break.
Sunglasses Capy: And here's the coolest capybara around, wearing sunglasses and soaking up the sun. Join the capybaras for a chill and fun day!

# What's in this project?
← README.md: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← index.html: This is the main web page for your site. The HTML defines the structure and content of the page using elements. You'll see references in the HTML to the JS and CSS files. Try clicking the image in the center of the page!

← style.css: CSS files add styling rules to your content. The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page. The style rules also make the image move when you click it.

← script.js: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript. The code in the JavaScript file runs when the page loads, and when the visitor clicks the button you can add using the code in the TODO.

Open each file and check out the comments (in gray) for more info.
